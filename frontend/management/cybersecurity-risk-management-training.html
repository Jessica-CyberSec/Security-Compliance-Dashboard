    <h2>🔐 Cybersecurity Risk Management Training for Management</h2>

    <h3>📌 Objective</h3>
    <p>Help management identify, evaluate, and mitigate cybersecurity risks as part of broader business planning and continuity.</p>

    <h3>🛠️ What Is Cybersecurity Risk Management?</h3>
    <p>It's the process of identifying threats to digital systems, assessing their potential impact, and implementing strategies to reduce the risk. This is crucial for protecting data, operations, and brand reputation.</p>

    <h3>🧠 Scenarios You Might Encounter</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Third-Party Data Exposure</b>: A supplier system gets compromised, exposing customer records.</li>
      <li><b>Disgruntled Insider</b>: A former employee still has access to confidential systems.</li>
      <li><b>Unprepared Disaster Recovery</b>: After a ransomware attack, there's no clear data recovery plan.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>⚠️ Common Risk Areas for Management</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Supply chain and vendor vulnerabilities</li>
      <li>Unauthorized insider access</li>
      <li>Lack of cyber insurance coverage</li>
      <li>Outdated or missing incident response plans</li>
      <li>Regulatory non-compliance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>✅ Risk Mitigation Best Practices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop and maintain a cybersecurity risk register</li>
      <li>Use role-based access and regularly review permissions</li>
      <li>Train employees to recognize threats and report incidents</li>
      <li>Implement disaster recovery and incident response policies</li>
      <li>Ensure all third-party partners meet your cybersecurity standards</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>📋 If a Cyber Incident Occurs</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Contain the threat (e.g., isolate affected systems)</li>
      <li>Alert IT/security teams and begin documentation</li>
      <li>Engage incident response and legal advisors</li>
      <li>Communicate to stakeholders with clarity</li>
      <li>Conduct post-incident analysis and update security protocols</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>🗣️ Sample Scenario & Response</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>Team Member:</i> “Someone clicked a suspicious link and now systems are acting strange.”<br>
      <i>You (Manager):</i> “Disconnect the workstation, alert IT, and let’s follow our response plan.”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>🎯 Final Reminder</h3>
    <p>Cyber risks evolve constantly. A proactive management strategy is the best defense against potential disruptions or losses.</p>
