    <h2>📦 Incident Reporting Training for Stock Staff</h2>

    <h3>📌 Objective</h3>
    <p>Develop awareness and discipline among warehouse staff to identify and report cybersecurity incidents quickly and accurately.</p>

    <h3>🛠️ Why Incident Reporting Matters</h3>
    <p>Stock staff are often closest to the technology and physical assets. Being alert to unusual behavior or system issues and reporting it can help prevent major security breaches or operational disruptions.</p>

    <h3>🧠 Situations to Recognize</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Lost Equipment:</b> A handheld scanner goes missing during a shift.</li>
      <li><b>Suspicious Access:</b> A staff member sees someone using a device who doesn’t belong there.</li>
      <li><b>Login Failures:</b> Repeated login attempts on a stockroom terminal outside business hours.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>⚠️ Common Incidents That Should Be Reported</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lost or stolen devices</li>
      <li>Unauthorized system access or login attempts</li>
      <li>Unfamiliar individuals accessing the stock area</li>
      <li>Changes in system behavior (slowdowns, errors, alerts)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>✅ What You Should Do</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Notify a supervisor immediately</li>
      <li>Do not attempt to fix or hide the problem</li>
      <li>Complete an incident report with as much detail as possible</li>
      <li>Secure the area if physical intrusion is suspected</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>📋 Example Scenario</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>Staff:</i> “I saw a person trying to log in to our terminal who I’ve never seen before.”<br>
      <i>You:</i> “Good call. Let's report that and check the access logs right away.”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>🎯 Final Reminder</h3>
    <p>Fast reporting = faster response = smaller risk. Protect the warehouse by being alert and speaking up.</p>
